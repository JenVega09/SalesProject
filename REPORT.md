2. How much better did the top salesperson do than the individual who came in second for the year?
The top salesperson, Michel DeFrance sold $6305.77 more than the second best salesperson, Dirk Stringer. 

3. Was there any relationship between the average sale amount for the top salespersons and the total sales?

4. How do you think the top selling salesperson gained so many sales? What was their strategy?

- Did they sell to many customers, or a dedicated few?
- Did they tend to sell a few big ticket (high priced) items, or did they focus on a high volume of lower priced items?
The top salesperson, Michel DeFrance sold to the customer who spent the most money.  He also had fewer sales but with higher priced items and only sold to three customers.  
 
5. What was the top selling product for the year? What was the lowest selling? (For both dollar amount sold and quantity sold).
The top selling products were the 'External Lock Washer 7' with a price of $0, the Mountain-100 Black, 38 with a price of $3374.99, and the Touring-3000 Blue, 54 with a price of $742.35.  
Each of these three items were sold 25 times.  
One might assume that the 'External Lock Washer 7' was included in the package of either the Mountain-100 or the Touring-3000 since a washer is typically a negligible value compared to the other two items. 
The lowest selling product was the 'Fender Set - Mountain' with a price tag of $21.98.  It only sold one time. 
There were 5 products that were the highest priced, which seem to all be variations of the same item: 'Road-150 Red' with a price tag of $3578.27
 

6. What problems did you find in the data? (For example, where there any products without a price?)
There were 48 products with a price of $0 that likely impacted the calculations for total sales and average sales.  In addition, there was one salesperson who did not have any sales.
